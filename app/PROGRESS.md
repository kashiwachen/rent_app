# Project Progress

## Pinned

- Project: Flutter-based Rental Management Application
- Working directory: /Users/oscar/self/rent_app/app
- Flutter SDK: 3.35.6 (verified and installed)
- Git repository: Active, main branch
- Development approach: Phase-based implementation (Phase 1 Week 1 in progress)
- Architecture: Clean architecture with Riverpod state management, Drift database
- Localization: Multi-language support (en, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, zh)
- Theme: Material 3 with light/dark mode support

## Decisions

- [2025-10-14] Use Drift for local database management (SQL-based, type-safe)
- [2025-10-14] Use Riverpod for state management (modern, maintainable)
- [2025-10-14] Use flutter_localizations with ARB files for i18n
- [2025-10-14] Implement Material 3 design system with custom theme
- [2025-10-14] Follow clean architecture pattern: core/, models/, repositories/, services/, screens/, widgets/, providers/
- [2025-10-14] Use pdf package for PDF generation/export functionality
- [2025-10-14] Use flutter_local_notifications for notification system

## Constraints

- [2025-10-14] Must support iOS, Android, and Web platforms
- [2025-10-14] Must provide offline-first functionality (local database primary)
- [2025-10-14] Must support multiple languages (English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese)
- [2025-10-14] Must follow Material Design 3 guidelines
- [2025-10-14] Code must pass all lint checks and tests before commits

- [2025-10-14] Project structure created with empty directories ready for Days 3-5 implementation
- [2025-10-14] Initial test suite passing (1 widget test)
- [2025-10-14] Git commit exists: d82b42f "feat: Phase 1 Week 1 Day 1-2 - Flutter project setup"
