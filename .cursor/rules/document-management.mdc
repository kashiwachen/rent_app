# Document Management Rules

## Core Documents
The OSCAR system maintains these critical documents throughout the workflow:

### 1. [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md) - Product Requirements Document
- **Owner**: Product Manager Agent
- **Purpose**: Detailed product requirements and user stories
- **Dependencies**: None (starting document)
- **Required Sections**:
  - Product Overview
  - Target Users and Scenarios
  - Feature Requirements and Priorities
  - User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
  - MVP Scope Definition
  - Success Metrics

### 2. [DESIGN_SPEC.md](mdc:DESIGN_SPEC.md) - System Design Specification
- **Owner**: System Architect Agent  
- **Purpose**: Technical architecture and implementation blueprint
- **Dependencies**: Must reference and fulfill [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md) requirements
- **Required Sections**:
  - System Architecture Overview
  - Technology Stack Decisions
  - Data Models and Database Schema
  - API Specifications
  - Component Design and Interfaces
  - Security and Performance Requirements
  - Implementation Guidelines

### 3. [README.md](mdc:README.md) - Project Documentation
- **Owner**: Software Engineer Agent
- **Purpose**: Project setup, usage, and maintenance guide
- **Dependencies**: Must align with implemented code and design specs
- **Required Sections**:
  - Project Description
  - Installation Instructions
  - Usage Examples
  - API Documentation
  - Development Setup
  - Deployment Guide

## Document Consistency Rules

### Version Control
- Each document must include creation and last modified timestamps
- Track which agent was responsible for each major revision
- Maintain change log for significant updates

### Cross-Reference Validation
- [DESIGN_SPEC.md](mdc:DESIGN_SPEC.md) must explicitly reference [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md) requirements
- Implementation code must align with [DESIGN_SPEC.md](mdc:DESIGN_SPEC.md) specifications
- [README.md](mdc:README.md) must accurately reflect implemented features

### Quality Standards
- All documents must use consistent markdown formatting
- Include clear section headers and table of contents
- Use proper code blocks and syntax highlighting
- Maintain professional tone and clear language
- Include diagrams and examples where helpful

## File Organization
```
/project-root/
├── PRD.md              # Product requirements
├── DESIGN_SPEC.md      # System design
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── /src/               # Implementation code
├── /docs/              # Additional documentation
└── /tests/             # Test files
```

## Handoff Validation
Before each phase transition, validate:

1. **Product → Architecture**: 
   - [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md) is complete and approved
   - All requirements are clearly defined
   - MVP scope is established

2. **Architecture → Implementation**:
   - [DESIGN_SPEC.md](mdc:DESIGN_SPEC.md) addresses all PRD requirements
   - Technical specifications are detailed and actionable
   - Architecture decisions are justified

3. **Implementation → Delivery**:
   - Code implements all design specifications
   - [README.md](mdc:README.md) provides accurate setup instructions
   - All deliverables are tested and functional

## Document Templates
Each agent should follow established templates for consistency and completeness. Templates ensure all required information is captured and properly formatted for the next phase of development.
