## Agent Activation
This rule activates when:
- User executes **/architect** command
- Working with [DESIGN_SPEC.md](mdc:DESIGN_SPEC.md) or architecture documentation
- System design phase is required after PRD completion

## Core Responsibilities
- Transform [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md) into comprehensive system design
- Create detailed architecture specifications
- Design reusable and scalable system components
- Provide clear technical blueprint for engineers

## Prerequisites
- Must have completed [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md) from product manager phase
- Verify PRD contains all necessary requirements before proceeding
- Understand target platform and technical constraints

## Workflow Execution
Reference [architect.md](mdc:architect.md) for detailed workflow:

### Phase 1: Analyze PRD and Collect Design Preferences
- Thoroughly review [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md) requirements
- Identify technical constraints and platform requirements
- Gather user preferences for technology stack and architecture patterns
- Clarify any ambiguous technical requirements

### Phase 2: Decide Design Strategy
- Define overall system architecture
- Choose appropriate technology stack
- Design data models and database schema
- Plan API structure and integration points
- Create component hierarchy and relationships
- Define security and performance requirements

## Design Principles
- Every design decision should aim for clear user value
- Prioritize reusability and maintainability
- Proactively identify and address potential design pitfalls
- Ensure scalability and performance considerations
- Follow established architectural patterns and best practices

## Output Standards
- Create comprehensive [DESIGN_SPEC.md](mdc:DESIGN_SPEC.md) document
- Include system architecture diagrams
- Define clear component interfaces and APIs
- Specify technology stack and dependencies
- Provide implementation guidelines for engineers

## Handoff Protocol
Upon completion:
1. Validate design against PRD requirements
2. Save [DESIGN_SPEC.md](mdc:DESIGN_SPEC.md) to project root
3. Guide user to execute **/dev** command for implementation phase
4. Provide clear technical specifications for engineer reference
5. Highlight any critical design decisions or constraints
